# Changelog

## v1.22.0

### UX Improvements

- **Voice to disconnected topic** — early exit before Whisper transcription; user sees a clear error with `/standalone` hint instead of a silent failure
- **Better "session not active" message** — shows project path, explains auto-reconnect, links to `/standalone` and `/sessions`
- **Typing indicator refresh** — typing action re-sent every 4s during long responses; correctly targets forum topic via `message_thread_id`
- **Queue depth feedback** — "⏳ In queue (#N)..." message when a request is waiting behind another in the per-topic queue
- **`/quickstart` command** — 5-step onboarding guide: forum group → project add → Claude Code launch
- **Session crash notifications** — forum topic receives a message when a session terminates unexpectedly
- **`escapeHtml()` utility** — shared in `bot/format.ts`; all user-supplied strings in HTML messages are now properly escaped
- **N+1 SQL eliminated** in `sessions/manager.ts` — `project_path` merged into existing SELECTs in `disconnect()` and `markStale()`

## v1.21.0

### Interactive Polls

Claude can ask clarifying questions as native Telegram polls (`send_poll` MCP tool). You tap answers, press **Submit ✅**, and results flow back automatically as a user message. Supports forum topic routing, 24h expiry, and vote retraction. See [Interactive Polls guide](guides/polls.md).

### Read Receipts

👀 reaction when the bot receives your message, ⚡ when Claude Code picks it up and starts working.

### Codex Code Review

OpenAI Codex CLI integration for AI-powered code review. Authenticate headlessly via `/codex_setup` (device flow, no terminal needed). Trigger via `/codex_review` or natural language. Falls back silently to Claude's native review on quota or auth errors. See [Codex Review guide](guides/codex.md).

### `/forum_clean` command

Scans all projects with a `forum_topic_id`, validates each against the Telegram API, and nulls out IDs that correspond to deleted topics. Run `/forum_sync` afterward to recreate missing topics.

## v1.20.0

### Forum Topics — One Topic Per Project

The primary UX model is now a **Telegram Forum Supergroup** where each project has a dedicated topic:

- `/forum_setup` — run once in the General topic; bot creates one topic per registered project and stores the group ID in `bot_config`
- `/project_add` — automatically creates a forum topic for the new project when forum is configured
- **Message routing** — `sessions/router.ts` resolves `message_thread_id` → project → active session; General topic (thread ID = 1) is control-only
- **Status messages** — `StatusManager` in `channel/status.ts` sends all status updates to the project topic; project name prefix suppressed (the topic already identifies the project)
- **Permission requests** — `PermissionHandler` in `channel/permissions.ts` sends Allow/Always/Deny buttons to the correct project topic
- **`reply` and `update_status` MCP tools** — automatically include `message_thread_id` when called from a forum session
- **Forum cache** — `bot/forum-cache.ts` lazy-loads `forum_chat_id` from DB with invalidation on setup/sync
- **DB migration v13** — `forum_topic_id INTEGER` column on `projects`, `bot_config` table for runtime settings
- **34 new unit tests** — `tests/unit/forum-topics.test.ts` covers routing logic, icon color rotation, `replyInThread`, StatusManager forum target, PermissionHandler forum target, migration schema shape
- **Backward compatible** — if `/forum_setup` was never run, the bot operates in DM mode unchanged

## v1.19.0

### Lease-Based Session Ownership
Replaced `pg_advisory_lock` with a `lease_owner` + `lease_expires_at` column in the `sessions` table (migration v12). The lease is renewed every 60 seconds; if the channel process crashes, the lease auto-expires after 3 minutes and another process can take over. Eliminates orphaned locks and connection-scope issues from PostgreSQL pool reconnects.

### Session State Machine
`sessions/state-machine.ts` defines valid status transitions and enforces them atomically. Invalid transitions (e.g., `terminated → active`) are blocked with a warning log. All disconnects in `sessions/manager.ts` and `channel/session.ts` now route through `transitionSession()`.

### File Intent Prompt

Files and photos received without a caption now trigger a prompt: `📎 filename saved. What should I do with it?`. The bot waits up to 5 minutes for the user's reply, then forwards the file to Claude with that text as the caption. Files with a caption still forward immediately.

### MessageService & SummarizationService
`services/message-service.ts` and `services/summarization-service.ts` wrap short-term memory and summarizer functions with a clean typed API, including `queue()` with attachments support and `pendingCount()`.

### Centralized Telegram API Client
`channel/telegram.ts` now exposes a unified `telegramRequest()` with automatic retry on 429 (respects `retry_after`) and 5xx errors (3 retries with backoff). All tool calls and status updates route through it.

### Cleanup Jobs with Dry-Run
`cleanup/jobs.ts` exposes `runAllCleanupJobs(dryRun)` with per-job row counts. `handleCleanup` in the bot and `helyx cleanup --dry-run` in the CLI use it to preview or apply cleanup.

### Security Fail-Fast
Bot exits immediately at startup if `ALLOWED_USERS` is empty and `ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true` is not set. No silent open-access deployments.

### Anthropic CLI Usage Tracking

Claude Code (Anthropic) model usage is now visible in the dashboard Stats page and the Telegram Mini App session monitor. When a CLI session response completes, the token count captured from the tmux/output monitor is recorded in `api_request_stats` with `provider=anthropic` and model from the session's `cli_config`. The "By model" table in both UIs now shows Sonnet/Opus/Haiku usage alongside standalone providers (Google AI, OpenRouter, Ollama).

### Media Forwarding

Photos, documents, and videos forwarded to Claude via MCP channel with structured `attachments` field (`base64` for images ≤5 MB, `path` for larger files). Migration v11 adds `attachments JSONB` to `message_queue`.

## v1.18.0

### Service Layer

`services/` directory introduces typed, testable wrappers over raw SQL for all domain operations. `ProjectService.create()` atomically handles INSERT + remote session registration. `PermissionService.transition()` enforces the state machine — `pending → approved | rejected | expired` — and rejects re-transitions into terminal states.

### Structured Logging (Pino)

All `console.log/error/warn` replaced with Pino structured logging. `logger.ts` exports two loggers: `logger` (stdout) and `channelLogger` (stderr fd 2, safe for MCP stdio). Every log entry carries structured fields (`sessionId`, `chatId`, `messageCount`) — searchable with any JSON log aggregator. Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in `.env` for verbose output.

### Channel Adapter — 7 Modules

The `channel.ts` monolith is now `channel/` with focused modules: `session.ts`, `permissions.ts`, `tools.ts`, `status.ts`, `poller.ts`, `telegram.ts`, `index.ts`. Each module owns one concern; the entrypoint wires them together.

### Environment Validation (Zod)

`config.ts` validates all env vars with Zod at startup. Missing required variables produce a clear error and immediate exit instead of a runtime crash on first use. `ALLOWED_USERS` is now required — `ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true` must be set explicitly for open access.

### Unit Test Suite

43 pure unit tests with no DB, no network, no Telegram: `tests/unit/session-lifecycle.test.ts`, `tests/unit/permission-flow.test.ts`, `tests/unit/memory-reconciliation.test.ts`. Run with `bun test tests/unit/` — completes in ~24ms.

## v1.17.0

See [ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md) for earlier version history.

## v1.14.0

### Google AI Provider in Setup Wizard

Re-added Google AI (Gemma 4) as an interactive option in `helyx setup`. The wizard now presents all four supported providers: Anthropic / Google AI / OpenRouter / Ollama. Selecting Google AI prompts for `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_AI_MODEL` (default: `gemma-4-31b-it`).

### MCP Tools: react and edit_message in Channel Adapter

Added `react` (set emoji reaction) and `edit_message` (edit a bot message) to the `channel.ts` stdio MCP adapter. Both tools were already available in the HTTP MCP server — now they work in all connection modes.

## v1.13.0

### Telegram Mini App — Claude Dev Hub

A mobile-first WebApp accessible via the **Dev Hub** button in Telegram. Features:
- **Git browser** — file tree, commit log, status, diff viewer
- **Permission manager** — Allow / Deny / Always Allow from mobile
- **Session monitor** — live session status (working/idle/inactive), API stats by model (including Anthropic Claude usage from CLI sessions), token totals with cost estimate, permission history with tool breakdown, recent tool calls

See [Mini App Guide](guides/webapp.md) for full feature description and auth details. Full technical spec: [`dashboard/webapp/SPEC.md`](dashboard/webapp/SPEC.md)

## v1.12.0

### Local Session Management

- **Delete local sessions from Telegram** — `/sessions` now shows `🗑 Delete` inline buttons for local sessions that are not active; clicking deletes all session data and refreshes the list
- **Delete local sessions from dashboard** — Sessions table gains a `Delete` action column; button is visible only for `source=local` + non-active rows; uses `useMutation` with query invalidation
- **`source` field in sessions API** — `GET /api/sessions` and `GET /api/overview` now return `source` (`remote` | `local` | `standalone`); added to `Session` TypeScript interface

### Session Source Refactoring

Three distinct modes now instead of two:

| `CHANNEL_SOURCE` env | Mode | DB behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `remote` | `helyx up` / tmux | One persistent session per project; reattaches on reconnect |
| `local` | `helyx start` | New temporary session each run; work summary on exit |
| _(not set)_ | Plain `claude` | No DB registration (`sessionId = null`), no polling |

Previously, unset `CHANNEL_SOURCE` defaulted to `local`. Now it is a distinct standalone mode that skips DB entirely — preventing phantom sessions when running `claude` without the bot.

### CLI Changes

- **`helyx start`** — no longer invokes `run-cli.sh`; spawns `claude` directly with `CHANNEL_SOURCE=local` (simpler path, no auto-restart loop for local sessions)
- **`helyx restart`** — after rebuild, syncs `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` from `.env` into `~/.claude.json` MCP server config (`syncChannelToken`), so channel auth stays in sync without manual edits
- **`run()` helper** — new `stream: true` option pipes stdout/stderr directly to terminal (used in restart for real-time build output)

## v1.11.0

### Dashboard Project Management
- **Projects page** — create, start, and stop projects directly from the web dashboard (previously Telegram-only)
- **SSE notifications** — `GET /api/events` streams `session-state` events to dashboard via Server-Sent Events
- **Browser notifications** — dashboard requests Notification permission and shows push notifications on session state changes
- **Projects API** — `GET/POST /api/projects`, `POST /api/projects/:id/start|stop`, `DELETE /api/projects/:id`

### Memory TTL per Type
- **Per-type retention** — each memory type has its own TTL: `fact` 90d, `summary` 60d, `decision` 180d, `note` 30d, `project_context` 180d
- **Hourly cleanup** — expired memories deleted automatically based on `created_at`
- **Configurable** — override via `MEMORY_TTL_FACT_DAYS`, `MEMORY_TTL_SUMMARY_DAYS`, etc.
- **DB migration v9** — `archived_at` column + partial index on `memories` table

## v1.10.0

### Smart Memory Reconciliation
- **LLM deduplication** — `/remember` and work summaries no longer blindly insert; similar memories are found via vector search, then `claude-haiku` decides ADD / UPDATE / DELETE / NOOP
- **Updated replies** — `/remember` now shows `Saved (#N)` / `Updated #N` / `Already known (#N)` based on what actually happened
- **project_context deduplication** — session exit summaries update existing project context instead of accumulating duplicates
- **Graceful fallback** — Ollama or Claude API unavailable → falls back to plain insert, no data loss
- **New config** — `MEMORY_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (default `0.35`) and `MEMORY_RECONCILE_TOP_K` (default `5`)

## v1.9.0

### Session Management Redesign
- **Persistent Projects** — `projects` DB table, `/project_add` saves to DB (not JSON file)
- **Remote/Local Sessions** — one remote session per project (persistent), multiple local (temporary per process)
- **Work Summary on Exit** — local session exit triggers AI summary of work done ([DECISIONS][FILES][PROBLEMS][PENDING][CONTEXT]), vectorized to long-term memory
- **Session Switch Briefing** — switching sessions shows last project context summary, injected as system context
- **Semantic Search** — `search_project_context` MCP tool + `search_context` command
- **Archival TTL** — messages and permission_requests archived on summarize, deleted after `ARCHIVE_TTL_DAYS` (default 30)
- **Status vocab** — `active | inactive | terminated` (was `active | disconnected`)
- **DB migrations v6-v8** — projects table, archived_at columns, project_id FK, unique remote-per-project

## v1.8.0

### Skills & Commands Integration
- **`/skills`** — Interactive skill browser with inline buttons (reads from `~/.claude/skills/`)
- **`/commands`** — Custom command launcher (reads from `~/.claude/commands/`)
- **`/hooks`** — View configured Hookify rules
- **Deferred input** — Tools requiring args prompt user then enqueue
- **Icon support** — 38+ emojis for quick visual identification

### Session Management Commands
- **`/add`** — Register project as Claude Code session (prompts for path, auto-switches)
- **`/model`** — Select Claude model via inline buttons (stored in `cli_config.model`)
- **Adapter pattern** — `adapters/ClaudeAdapter` (message_queue), extensible registry
- **Session router** — `sessions/router.ts` typed routing: standalone / cli / disconnected

### CLI Refactoring
- **`start [dir]`** — Register + launch project in current terminal (replaces old start = docker-only)
- **`docker-start`** — New command for `docker compose up -d` (old `start` behavior)
- **`add [dir]`** — Now registration-only (saves to config + bot DB, no launch)
- **`run [dir]`** — New command to launch registered project in terminal
- **`attach [dir]`** — New command to add window to running tmux `bots` session
- **tmux session renamed** — `claude` → `bots` (hosts both claude and opencode windows)

### Database Improvements
- **JSONB normalization** — Safe PostgreSQL storage with explicit casting
- **Read-merge-write** — Concurrent-safe provider config updates
